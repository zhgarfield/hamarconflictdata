Description: A database of 160 self-reports of inter-individual conflicts among a 
     Hamar agro-pastoralists society, reported by 99 adults. Data include measures of
     cause of conflict, if a third-party mediator was involved, if the conflict was
     resolved, and other conflict-level meta-data.
