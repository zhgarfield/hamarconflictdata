# hamarconflictdata

A database of 160 self-reports of inter-individual conflicts among a Hamar agro-pastoralists society, reported by 99 adults. Data include measures of cause of conflict, if a third-party mediator was involved, if the conflict was resolved, and other conflict-level meta-data. 

This package includes data used in the publication, *Inter-personal conflicts and third-party mediation in a pastoralist society*, by Zachary H. Garfield & Luke Glowacki.

See the preprint of the same name for additional details.
